## 🚀 What is Vision Bridge?

**Vision Bridge** is an AI system that transforms video content into natural, context-aware audio narration for visually impaired users.

Instead of robotic frame-by-frame labels, Vision Bridge:

- Understands scenes
- Tracks actions over time
- Merges context intelligently
- Speaks smooth human-like descriptions

---

## 🌍 Why It Matters

Over **2.2 billion people** worldwide live with vision impairment.

Yet most videos:
- ❌ Lack audio descriptions
- ❌ Are inaccessible on social media
- ❌ Provide no contextual understanding

Vision Bridge changes that.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### 1️⃣ Frame Processing
- Extracts 1 FPS using OpenCV
- Scene change detection
- Image preprocessing pipeline

### 2️⃣ Vision-Language Understanding
- BLIP-2 / CLIP / ViT-GPT2
- Generates semantic captions
- Transfer learning-based

### 3️⃣ Context Intelligence (Core Innovation)
Raw AI Output:
```
"A man"
"A man"
"A man walking"
```

After Vision Bridge smoothing:
```
"A man is walking down the street toward a crosswalk."
```

Techniques:
- Semantic similarity (Sentence Transformers)
- Temporal merging
- Action continuity tracking
- Event filtering

### 4️⃣ Voice Synthesis
- gTTS (free)
- Coqui TTS (open-source)
- ElevenLabs (premium, realistic)

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| 🧠 Temporal Smoothing | Removes repetitive narration |
| 🚶 Action Tracking | Describes motion across frames |
| 📍 Spatial Awareness | "Car approaching from the left" |
| 🚨 Priority Alert System | Highlights people, vehicles, obstacles |
| 🔎 Event Detection | Narrates meaningful changes only |

---

## 🎯 Example Output

### Before Vision Bridge:
> "A man. A man. A car. A man."

### After Vision Bridge:
> "A man is walking down the street. A red car approaches from the left and stops at the intersection."
